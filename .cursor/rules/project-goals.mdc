I would like to create a react native IOS workout app. I would like you to help me design this app, but please do not start writing code only write code when I confirm for the specific part we are discussing.

Goal of this app is to be able to track my gym progress. 

I would like to use the following stack:
- React Native for Frontend
- Python for Backend
- TypeScript for Frontend
- FastAPI for Backend
-Zustand for React State Management
-Supabase for Databases
- Expo Go (for testing on mobile device)

I would like my app to have the following components:
-Login Page
-Main Content in Two Views switched by slider
-- View 1: Logging Current Workout Session
-- View 2: Viewing Statistics of Previous Workout Session
